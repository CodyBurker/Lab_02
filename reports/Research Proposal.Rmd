# Background and Research Question

The COVID-19 pandemic is the first pandemic seen in a century, affecting each individual worldwide. While many countries issued lockdowns, travel quarantines, and other COVID-19 restrictions on a federal level, the US federal government placed the power with the governors to regulate the implementation of these restrictions on a state-by-state basis. There has been increased skepticism on the true effectiveness of restrictions in slowing down the spread of COVID-19, especially due to the amount of economic impact resulting from these procedures.\
   
From this, we will be investigating the following research question:\
`Does a state's implementation of closures of public spaces, stay at home orders, and face mask mandates have an effect on their COVID-19 case counts?`

# Data sources

1.  [COVID-19 US State Policy Database](www.tinyurl.com/statepolicies) A database of state policy responses to the pandemic, compiled by researchers at the Boston University School of Public Health.
2.  [NY Times Covid-19 Data Repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) A series of data files with cumulative counts of coronavirus cases in the United States, at the state and county level, over time.
2.  [Office of Personell Management](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/federal-holidays/#url=2021) A list of U.S. federal holidays.

From data source (1), we expect to get variables:\
-  Closure and reopenings: Start and end dates of closures of public spaces\
-  Stay at home: Start and end dates of stay at home policies\
-  Face masks: Start and end date of face mask mandates\
-  Population per square mile: State's population per square mile\
From data source (2) we expect to get the variable:\
-  Weekly COVID-19 case counts
From data source (3) we expect to get the variable:\
-  A list of federal holidays

# Methodology and Expected outcome

We will investigate the causal effect the following variables have on the 7-day moving average of cumulative COVID-19 cases:\
- Closure and reopenings (whether a stay-at-home order was in effect at that time and number of days since it started) \
- When mask mandates were required (as an indicator variable, and number of days since the mandate started)\
- Whether the state implemented legal consequences for violating stay-at-home orders\
We will assume that these variables have no effect on COVID-19 cases, and will construct tests to investigate whether a relationship exists using three regression models, starting with stay at home and population per square mile as our key explanatory variables in our limited model.
